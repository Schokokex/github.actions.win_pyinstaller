# github.actions.win_pyinstaller
It's 8 days after i created the repo, and i dont have any idea what i did back then.

I guess i tried to enhance the https://github.com/JackMcKew/pyinstaller-action-windows for whatever reason, so that the build.spec file gets generated automatically...

I guess i gave up when trying to understand the original repo.
